# Unzipper 

These are the code files for the unzipper project. 
We have built a pully retreival sytem for a zipline that can autonomously bring the pulley back to the top of the zipline after a rider has got off the line.
The code runs on the Arduino framework and the platformIO build platform. 
The ESP32 is the microcontroller we are using to support this project. The ESP32 runs the program and hosts a server that you can connect to via WIFI to adjust settings on the system. 
It is built into a custom designed circuit that we use to control the motors, lights, and sensors.
